3DTankGameProject
=================
This project is an old graphics project I started working on in 2009 using Open GL GLUT. 
It is a 2-player tank shooting game where one has to adjust the angle and speed of the shot to 
successfully hit the other player, all while moving back and forth on a lateral plane. All objects
in the program are rendered in 3D.
